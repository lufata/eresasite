<h1>What Skates Should i Get</h1>
<h3>Why do i need new skates?</h3>
<p>over time, I've become pretty decent at rollerskating, it's probably the thing I spend the most of my time doing.
    The skates that I use right now are a pair of moxi beachbunnies with some bones sliders and radar wheels for the skatepark.
    While theyre not actually very old, because of how often i use them it seems like they are. 
    <del>I am a few bad falls away from having holes in them</del>.
    they're really nice skates besides that, but they're not even the right size! which leads to a variety of problems and is probably a safety hazard.
</p>
<h2>so what are my options?</h2>
<p>Anyone who knows their skates would automatically recommend a variation of the following:</p>
<ul> <li>Moxi Lolly</li> <li>Moxi panther</li> <li>Moxi Jack boot</li><li>moxi beachbunny</li> <li><del>impala skate</del></li><li>custom vans set up</li><li>chaya Karmas</li></ul>
<p> However, I'm specifically looking for a pair of skates with <em>strong ankle support</em> for landing jumps. So vans and impalas are 
    pretty out of the question. I know much less about Chaya skates than any other brand so i can get rid of that too.
</p>
<!--impala is crossed off because they're low quality and people still recommend them for aggressive skating, which is all around a dangerous decision because of how poorly mmanufactured they are.
it is mostly just an inside joke with myself-->
<h2> which leaves Moxi's big four.</h2>
<h3>the jack</h3>
<p><b><i>I dont really want to pay 400 dollars for a boot that doesnt even come with a plate so i am not going to get the jack.</i></b></p>
<h3>the Lolly</h3>
<p>the <sup>Lolly</sup> is generally considered the intermediate/beginner skate that can be used for all kinds
of skating, it's also normally the first skate people recommend for park skating. They're made of high quality suede and come with nice outdoor wheels (just about the nicest rollerskate wheels 
money can buy). They'd be really nice for skating around and stuff, but i'm not so sure about the skatepark. theyre not the stiffest skates,
and honestly besides comfort i dont really understand why theyre so highly recommended for use in the skateparks when they offer so 
little ankle support. The plate it comes with is also somewhat of an issue for me, coming from a pair 
of beachbunnys, it would at least leave me with a few broken bones i feel like. The wheel base is much further 
forward on the lollys plate, which can lead to falling backwards, which sucks really bad if you're trying to land a trick. 
The last thing about the lollys is thier aesthetics, they're hand-made and come in a total of eleven colors and theyre all so nice.
However they end up coming to a total of like <code>$300</code></p>
<h3><i>the beachbunny</i></h3>
<p>The beachbunny is a cheaper version of the lolly. Instead of suede it comes in vinyl, which is supposed to be a downgrade, but 
    in terms of stability, the beachbunny is <i>much</i> stiffer. The wheelbase is further back which leads to easier landings
    and less slip backs. Wear and tear is <em><b>very</b></em> visable on the vinyl when it is scraped. The wheels it come with kinda suck 
    for the skatepark and dont have a hub, but i'd be changing them out anyways. the plate it comes with is pretty heavy, which 
    i like outside of the skatepark but when you add sliders on top of that weight, it's almost too much. theres 5 color options
    and it comes to a total of <code>$150</code>
</p>
<h3>the <em><sub>panther</sub></em></h3>
<p>The panther is a lolly-beachbunny mutant hybrid with little to none of the personality or customization of it's predecessors besides laces
    and wheels. And yet somehow it manages to be <mark><i>the best option out of any skate on the market right now.</i></mark> <ins><b>somehow this thing beats out the jackboot.</b></ins> 
    Moxi's founder, Michelle Steillen herself has spoken volumes of the skates quality.
</p>
<blockquote>When I have this boot laced up and tightened, it feels like the jack-boot to me... This is my go-to boot right now.</blockquote>
<p>This could just be clever marketing on her part but many other skaters in the community that <i>aren't</i> affiliated with moxi
say the boot is super nice for bowl skating. And since it is made of suede, it is <i>way</i> more resistant to abrasion than than the 
beach bunny. Theyre also stiffer than the beachbunny, and is supposedly more comfortable too. They end up at a price of <code>$220</code></p>
<h2>So Why don't I Just Get the Panther?</h2>
